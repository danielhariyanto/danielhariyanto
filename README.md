## ABOUT ME
I'm studying Computer Science and Applied Math, minoring in Business, at Brandeis University (Class of 2023). Currently, I'm interning as a software engineer at [PayPal](http://paypal.com/). Prior to PayPal, I have worked at multiple tech startups based in the US and Israel, namely [TapTapes](https://www.taptapes.com/), [Vibo](https://vibodj.com/), and [AgroFides](https://www.agrofides.com/).

I am passionate about creating scalable impact via digital innovation. Through my past technical internships and hackathons, I have been exposed to a wide breadth of AI & software technologies which I have used to build impactful humanitarian projects in my spare time, like [Mobile Memory](https://mobilememory.app/). These opportunities have cultivated me to become an effective technical leader and team player.

In my spare time, I avidly
- engage in hackathons üë®‚Äçüíª
- compose music üéπ
- fly light aircraft at the nearby Hanscom Airfield ‚úàÔ∏è

### Research
While pursuing CS and Applied Math, I am also involved in biophysics research. I am currently an NSF-funded undergraduate research fellow at the NSF Materials Research Science & Engineering Center based at Brandeis, where I conduct DNA nanotech research. I utilize my strong scientific and analytical research background to complement my skills as an AI and software engineer.

I conduct biophysics & DNA nanotech experimental research on liquid-liquid phase separation at the [Rogers Lab](http://www.rogers-lab.com/) using nanostructures called DNA nanostars. I often use Python to construct models, graphs, and calculations to complement my research. More info [here](https://github.com/danielhariyanto/SummerResearch).
