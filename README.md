## ABOUT ME
Hi, I'm Daniel.
I'm a builder at heartâ€”driven not by profit or power, but by a desire to create meaningful impact. And for me, impact isnâ€™t measured in metricsâ€”itâ€™s measured in people helped.

I believe technology and innovation are most powerful when they serve othersâ€”not just the one who built them. Whether through startups, side projects, or my work at Microsoft, I build with one question in mind: <i>Will this create real value for real people?</i>

That question reflects something deeper: character is what matters most. That means choosing integrity over ease, humility over ego, and service over self. Whether Iâ€™m designing a product or leading a team, my goal is the sameâ€”to build in a way that honors God, uplifts others, and leaves the world better than I found it. Because how we build is just as important as what we build.

If this inspires even one person to hold fast to what truly matters, then Iâ€™ve done something worthwhile.
