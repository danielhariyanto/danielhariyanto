# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Daniel!

## ABOUT ME
I'm studying Computer Science and Applied Math, minoring in Business, at Brandeis University (Class of 2023). Currently, I'm interning as a product manager at [Microsoft](http://microsoft.com/). Prior to Microsoft, I interned as a software engineer at [PayPal](https://paypal.com/) and several tech startups based in the US and Israel, namely [Bevi](https://www.bevi.co/), [Mappo](https://mappo.world/), [SOLO](https://www.imsolo.ai/), [TapTapes](https://www.taptapes.com/), [Vibo](https://vibodj.com/), and [AgroFides](https://www.agrofides.com/).

I am passionate about problem solving. I enjoy being challenged by the limitations within my environment and find passion transforming them into sources of inspiration and ideation. I'm a serial ideator who often finds himself building real-world-problem-solving software projects with fellow passionate students, or participating in weekend hackathons. This is how I founded what is now a MassChallenge healthtech startup that aims to provide inexpensive and accessible Alzheimer's screening to anyone with a smartphone (check out [Mobile Memory](https://www.mobilememory.app/)).

Through my strong technical skills, together with my leadership and management skills, I aspire to continue creating scalable impact via digital innovation in the future. I aim to work with mission-driven companies to build user-centric products that solve real-world challenges communities are facing or will face in the future.

### Research
While pursuing CS and Applied Math, I was also involved in biophysics research. I was an NSF-funded undergraduate research fellow at the NSF Materials Research Science & Engineering Center based at Brandeis, where I conducted DNA nanotech experimental research. I studied liquid-liquid phase separation at the [Rogers Lab](http://www.rogers-lab.com/) using nanostructures called DNA nanostars. I often used Python to construct models, graphs, and calculations to complement my research. More info [here](https://github.com/danielhariyanto/summer-research-2020).

I utilize my strong scientific and analytical research background to complement my skills as a software engineer and data/ML scientist.
