# Hi there <img src="https://github.com/danielhariyanto/danielhariyanto/blob/master/assets/wave.gif" width="30px">, I'm [Daniel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielhariyanto/)!

## ABOUT ME
I'm a sophomore at Brandeis University studying Computer Science 💻 and Biological Physics 🔬.

I believe in the empowering capabilities of knowledge, and I embrace my opportunity as a scholar to constantly learn and grow in the hope of advancing my abilities and erudition at the intersectio
n of research and tech. I am a passionate knowledge-seeker and a driven opportunity-chaser who aspires to use my experiences to benefit society.

In my spare time, I avidly
- engage in hackathons 👨‍💻
- compose music 🎹
- fly light aircraft at the nearby Hanscom Airfield ✈️

#### Computer Science
- Programming Languages: Java (2 yrs), Python (1 yr), JavaScript (1/2 yr), C++ (1/2 yr), R (1/2 yr)
- Front-end Languages: HTML (1 yr), CSS (1 yr), JavaScript (1 yr), React (1/2 yr), React Native (1/2 yr)
- Back-end Languages: Flask (1 yr), SQL (1/2 yr), PHP (1/2 yr), ArangoDB (1/2 yr)
- Techniques: artificial intelligence (1/2 yr), machine learning (1/2 yr), statistical programming (1 yr), data visualization (1 yr), natural language processing (1/2 yr), optical character recognition (1/2 yr), object recognition (1/2 yr), microprocessor technology (1/2 yr)

#### Biological Physics
I conduct biophysics & DNA nanotech experimental research on liquid liquid phase separation at the [Rogers Lab](http://www.rogers-lab.com/) using nanostructures called DNA nanostars. I often use Python to construct models, graphs, and calculations to complement my research. More info [here](https://github.com/danielhariyanto/SummerResearch).

## HACKATHON PROJECTS
I enjoy meeting passionate, like-minded people at hackathons and creating innovative, easily implementable tech solutions to current problems. Check out the projects from previous hackathons:
