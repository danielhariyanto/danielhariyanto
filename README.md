## ABOUT ME
I'm a junior at Brandeis University studying Computer Science and Applied Math, minoring in Business.

<b>Relevant courses</b>: Advanced Programming Techniques in Java, Data Structures & Algorithms, Operating Systems, Fundamentals of AI, Deep Learning, Practical ML with Big Data, Numerical Methods, Discrete Math, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equations, Probability, Statistics

I believe in the empowering capabilities of knowledge. I embrace my opportunity as a scholar to advance my abilities and erudition at the intersection of research and tech. I am a passionate knowledge-seeker and a driven opportunity-chaser who aspires to use my experiences to create impact through innovation.

In my spare time, I avidly
- engage in hackathons üë®‚Äçüíª
- compose music üéπ
- fly light aircraft at the nearby Hanscom Airfield ‚úàÔ∏è

#### Research
While pursuing CS and Applied Math, I am also involved in biophysics research. I am currently an NSF-funded undergraduate research fellow at the NSF Materials Research Science & Engineering Center based at Brandeis, where I conduct DNA nanotech research. I utilize my strong scientific and analytical research background to complement my skills as an AI and software engineer.

I conduct biophysics & DNA nanotech experimental research on liquid-liquid phase separation at the [Rogers Lab](http://www.rogers-lab.com/) using nanostructures called DNA nanostars. I often use Python to construct models, graphs, and calculations to complement my research. More info [here](https://github.com/danielhariyanto/SummerResearch).
